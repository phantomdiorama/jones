Give me the whip.

Throw me the idol.

human-readable snake_case filenames pulled from the page title.

## Requirements

- python 3
- [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)

## Usage

```

## Notes

- First Python project
- Based on earlier non-python gist [here](https://gist.github.com/phantomdiorama/dad53caa305c9fee40d31e023613bc2e)
- Probably couldâ€™ve also been a gist
